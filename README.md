## LeetHub progress and numbers (YouTube Video):
[![LeetHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43754306/165053510-a757c95e-c3bc-49d5-995c-7a52368abd37.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o33PIjqlOgw "LeetHub saves lives!")

## What is LeetHub?
<p>A chrome extension that automatically pushes your code to GitHub when you pass all tests on a <a href="http://leetcode.com/">Leetcode</a> problem. </p>


## How fast is it really?
### THIS FAST (~400ms, 530x speed improvement)!

## Why LeetHub?
<p> <strong>1.</strong> Recruiters <em>want</em> to see your contributions to the Open Source community, be it through side projects, solving algorithms/data-structures, or contributing to existing OS projects.<br>
As of now, GitHub is developers' #1 portfolio. LeetHub just makes it much easier (autonomous) to keep track of progress and contributions on the largest network of engineering community, GitHub.</p>

<p> <strong>2.</strong> There's no easy way of accessing your leetcode problems in one place! <br>
Moreover, pushing code manually to GitHub from Leetcode is very time consuming. So, why not just automate it entirely without spending a SINGLE additional second on it? </p>

## Why did I build LeetHub?
<p>
The coding interview is arguably the most important part of your interview process, given you get the interview first. As someone who's received multiple internship offers from Fortune 100 companies, getting the interview in the first place is not easy!<br>
And that's what LeetHub is supposed to do: indirectly improving your coding skills while improving your portfolio to ACE that interview at <em>insert_name_here</em>!
</p>

# Let's see you ACE that coding interview!
